# Requirements for this project. These versions were taken from the project's
# virtualenv under `backend/Lib/site-packages` and should reproduce the
# environment used during development. Adjust pins as needed for your deploy.

fastapi==0.121.2
uvicorn==0.38.0
passlib==1.7.4
# Use bcrypt 4.x to avoid behavior changes in bcrypt 5.x that raise on >72-byte inputs
bcrypt==4.3.0
motor==3.7.1
pymongo==4.15.4
pydantic==2.12.4
pydantic-settings==2.12.0
python-dotenv==1.2.1

# optional / helpful packages often used with FastAPI
websockets==15.0.1
watchfiles==1.1.1
anyio==4.11.0
starlette==0.49.3

# Note: if you prefer the native bcrypt backend (faster), you can install
# a bcrypt>=5.x wheel and remove the PASSLIB_BUILTIN_BCRYPT env override in
# `main.py`. For now this requirements file pins the 4.x bcrypt used in dev.
